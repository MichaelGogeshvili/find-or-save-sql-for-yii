I've amended CActiveRecord thus porting into Yii the grails find-by-... paradigm.

EVERYTHING IS 100% UNIT-TESTED.

Many tasks now being done by handy one-liners; 

There were many polluting temporal variables, 

Long if-else blocks are now replaced by plug-in closures(with typical ones 
already being ready in library).
 


More features to come: 

1. Innovative in Yii: migration-to-modelset conversion; and viceversa.

2. Delete-by(), delete-all-by() with closure injections.

3. Pivot select : construct-x paradigm.

4. recursive selects: construct-tree paradigm.

5. input/output filters injection in select-by(closure in, closure out).

6. plugins for: xml/rss, json, html/table, html/block.

7. remoting.

Closures for generating standard encoded data help to shave another 40% of controller thickness.

Asynchronous transfer binary dumps instead of parsed data. 


YET ANOTHER INNOVATION.

A new soft paradigm where a half-rigid view gets populated by controller.
It is in contrast to hard controllers who overwrited views from scratch; 
It is featuring more predictability and robustness, improvement of user 
experience, would transfer data with low or no flickering at populating views;
